Making captcha work in magento 1.9 (RWD theme)
----------------------------------------------

Captcha was disabled in the RWD theme that magento 1.9 uses.

This was done by simply placing an empty layout xml file into the theme.

To make captcha work in magento 1.9: 

* Place a copy of the base captcha.xml file into your own theme layout folder.

   cp app/design/frontend/base/default/layout/captcha.xml app/design/frontend/YOUR_PACKAGE/THEME/layout/captcha.xml

* or, delete that file from the rwd theme to fallback to base, 

    rm app/design/frontend/rwd/default/layout/captcha.xml

Contact Us Captcha
------------------

* Enable in admin under Customer Configuration by selecting COntacts in available forms list
* Unfortunately the core contact us form does not have before or after form elements block, so you will need to adjust your contact us form to display the capctha.

 Edit the contact form located here: 
 
    app/design/frontend/[rwd|base|your package]/[default|your theme]/template/contacts/form.phtml
 
 place the following line into the form, anywhere between the form elements. 

    <?php echo $this->getChildHtml('recaptcha'); ?>

Product Review Us Captcha
-------------------------

* Enable in admin under Customer Configuration by selecting 'reviews' in available forms list
* Unfortunately the core product review form does not have an after form elements block, so you will need to adjust your reviews form to display the capctha.

 Edit the reviews form located here: 
 
    app/design/frontend/[rwd|base|your package]/[default|your theme]/template/review/form.phtml
 
 place the following line into the form, anywhere between the form elements. 

    <?php echo $this->getChildHtml('recaptcha'); ?>
